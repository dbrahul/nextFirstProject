# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbrahul/nextJsProject.git
cd nextJsProject


Install the dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
